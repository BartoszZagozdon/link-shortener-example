# link-shortener-example
Example done based on https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G

In this example I made a nice looking responsive website layout using HTML and CSS. Using JS the website simulates creating shorten links.
Normally shorten links would be fetched from the API.
